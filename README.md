✅ Key Features Required
Feature	Description
Two-way Screen Sharing	Real-time streaming between PC and mobile in both directions
Remote Input Control	Control mouse/keyboard on PC and tap/drag on Android remotely
Auto-Start on Boot	Both apps should run silently at system boot
Fixed Trusted Code	No UI/prompt; uses a saved trusted code to auto-connect
AES-Encrypted Communication	All screen/input data is encrypted end-to-end
Connection Retry/Recovery	Keeps trying to reconnect after reboot or network loss
Lightweight UI (Optional)	Minimal UI for showing connection status, logs, and manual override

🔨 Technology Stack
Layer	PC (Windows)	Mobile (Android)
Language	C# (WPF / WinUI / .NET 6 or 7)	C# (.NET MAUI / Android native bridge)
Screen Capture	Windows.Graphics.Capture	Android MediaProjection (via JNI)
Input Simulation	InputSimulator / WinAPI	Accessibility Service / Shell Command
Networking	TCP Socket or SignalR over WebSocket	Same
Encryption	AES-256 + optional TLS	Same
Auto-Start	Registry (Run key)	BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast receiver

🪜 Build Phases (Step-by-Step)
📦 Phase 1: Project Setup
Create three projects in one solution:

Stealth.Shared (Class Library)

Stealth.PC (.NET WPF/WinUI)

Stealth.Mobile (.NET MAUI Android App)

Create shared classes: Protocol, Encryption, TrustedCodeManager

🎥 Phase 2: Screen Sharing (PC → Mobile)
Implement screen capture using Windows.Graphics.Capture

Compress image using MJPEG or bitmap

Stream over TCP socket or WebSocket to mobile

On mobile, decode and render the image in a MAUI Image control

🖱️ Phase 3: Remote Input Control (Mobile → PC)
Map mobile gestures to input events

Send input events via socket (mouse move, click, keyboard)

Simulate them on PC using InputSimulator or WinAPI

📲 Phase 4: Screen Sharing (Mobile → PC)
Use Android MediaProjection (with permissions)

Stream screen as JPEG/H.264 over socket

Decode and render in WPF canvas or image panel

🤳 Phase 5: Remote Input (PC → Mobile)
Send cursor movement and tap commands

On mobile, use AccessibilityService or shell input to simulate touch/tap

(Optional: Root may simplify this if non-root input is blocked)

🔁 Phase 6: Persistent Connection (Trusted Code)
Add a trusted_id.txt on both devices

During connection handshake:

If codes match, accept connection silently

If not, disconnect or request manual input (optional)

Store hashed code securely on device

🚀 Phase 7: Auto Start on Boot
PC:

Add registry key in HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run

Android:

Use BroadcastReceiver that listens for BOOT_COMPLETED

Start background service that connects silently if trusted code matches

🔒 Phase 8: Security Features
Encrypt all socket data using AES

Optionally add TLS (e.g. use self-signed certs or trust within LAN)

Log session start, device ID, IP, and activity (for debug or forensic)

💅 Phase 9: Optional UI
Minimal dashboard showing:

Connection status

Devices connected

Manual connect/disconnect

Toggle control direction (PC → Mobile or Mobile → PC)

🧪 Phase 10: Testing & Optimization
Run on real devices:

Android phones with different screen sizes

Windows 10/11 machines

Optimize latency and compression

Retry logic for network failure

Ensure silent reconnect after boot

✨ Optional Enhancements
Feature	Description
QR Code Connect	Scan QR instead of typing trusted code
File Transfer	Send files between devices
Clipboard Sync	Shared clipboard across platforms
Voice Chat	Built-in audio stream
Remote Shutdown	Turn off/reboot connected PC remotely

✅ Final Goal
Deliver a fully automated remote access system that can:

Launch silently on boot

Connect based on saved code

Share screens and control each other

Run on both PC and Android, without prompts

🔚 Summary
Stealth is not just a remote tool, it's a low-latency, cross-platform, auto-connecting control system. Built with C# and MAUI, it gives you full ownership, flexibility, and learning experience.
